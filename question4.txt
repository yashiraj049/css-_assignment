Q4.How are inline and block elements different from each other?

In HTML, elements are categorized into two main types: inline elements and block elements. The main difference between them lies in their display behavior, layout, and how they interact with other elements.
Inline Elements: Inline elements are those that do not start on a new line and only take up the space needed to display their content. They are typically used for text-level elements, such as:
- span
- a 
- img 
- input 
- label
- strong
- em
- u
Characteristics of inline elements:
- They do not start on a new line.
- They only take up the space needed to display their content.
- They can be wrapped to the next line if the content is too long.
- They cannot have a width or height set explicitly.
- They are typically used for text-level elements.
Block Elements:- Block elements, on the other hand, are those that start on a new line and take up the full width available. They are typically used for structural elements, such as:
- div
- p 
- h1-h6 
- ul 
- ol 
- table
- form

Characteristics of block elements:
- They start on a new line.
- They take up the full width available.
- They can have a width and height set explicitly.
- They can contain other block-level elements or inline elements.
- They are typically used for structural elements.
